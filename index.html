                <strong>Welcome.</strong> My name is Michal Mrena and I am PhD student a the <a href="https://www.fri.uniza.sk/en/" target="_blank">Faculty of Management Science and Informatics</a>. My research deals with Decision Diagrams and their applications in reliability analysis of complex systems. I like programming and different areas of Computer Science. My favourite languages are C++ and Haskell, but I am also familiar with C#, Java and couple of others such as PHP or R.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've created this website to publish documentation for some projects that I've created and that we use in our research. Since I like to program in the C++ language I would also like to publish some thoughts on the language that might be useful for beginers.
