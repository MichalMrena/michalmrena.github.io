                <strong>Welcome.</strong> My name is Michal Mrena and I am a PhD student a the <a href="https://www.fri.uniza.sk/en/">Faculty of Management Science and Informatics</a>. My research deals with Decision Diagrams and their applications in reliability analysis of complex systems. I've created this website to publish documentation for some projects that I am involved in and that we use in our research. To make this page have more menu items I will also publish some thoughts on programming that I think might be interesting for beginners.
            </p>
            <p>
                 My thoughts on programming will be restricted to C++ which is my primary language. I don't want to present myself as an expert. I just hope that I can offer some useful insights - at least for the beginners. Besides C++ I also like to code in Haskell and I am also familiar with OOP languages such as C# and Java.
            </p>
