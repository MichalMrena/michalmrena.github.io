    <strong>Welcome.</strong> My name is Michal Mrena and I am a PhD student a the <a href="https://www.fri.uniza.sk/en/">Faculty of Management Science and Informatics</a>. My research deals with Decision Diagrams and their applications in the reliability analysis of complex systems. I've created this website to publish documentation for some projects that I am involved in and that we use in our research. To make this page have more menu items I will also publish some thoughts on programming that I think might be interesting for beginners.
</p>
<p>
     My thoughts on programming will be restricted to C++ which is my primary language. I don't want to present myself as an expert. I just hope that I can offer some useful insights &ndash; at least for the beginners. Besides C++ I also like to code in Haskell and I am also familiar with OOP languages such as C# and Java.

                The site follows noble ideas of the <a href="https://thebestmotherfucking.website/">thebestmotherf*cking.website</a>
                which more people should consider doing. The Internet would be much more informative and pleasant experience.
