                <strong>TeDDy</strong> which stands for "<span class="highlighted-letter">Te</span>mplated <span class="highlighted-letter">D</span>ecision <span class="highlighted-letter">D</span>iagram librar<span class="highlighted-letter">y</span>" is a C++ library for creation and manipulation of Decision Diagrams. Its source code, installation guide and short description with examples is available on <a href="https://github.com/MichalMrena/DecisionDiagrams/">Github</a>. This page contains its documentation and thanks to the Unicode also its mascot "U+1F9F8" ðŸ§¸.

            <p>
                Main page of the doxygen documentation for the library is available <a href="teddy/doxygen/html/index.html">here</a>. All of the library functions for diagram manipulation are implemented in the <a href="teddy/doxygen/html/classteddy_1_1diagram__manager.html">diagram_manager</a> class. You are probably here to see that one. As with the diagram manipulation, the library functions for reliability analysis are implemented in the <a href="teddy/doxygen/html/classteddy_1_1reliability__manager.html">reliability_manager</a> class. Last but not least, there is the <a href="teddy/doxygen/html/classteddy_1_1diagram.html">diagram</a> class which represents the diagram and is used in both aforementioned classes.

                TeDDy's <a href="TODO">github</a> page contains a brief description of is implementation in terms of algorithms and data structures. There are couple of other aspects concerning the programming side that I think might are interesting (at least at time of writing). In no particular order they are:
